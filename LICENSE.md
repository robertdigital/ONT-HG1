License Agreement
==================

This site contains my genome, extracted from white blood cells sequenced using Oxford Nanopore’s MinION(TM) device, and I assert full Copyrights over it as its Author.  ©2016- Clive G. Brown.

I assert all Copyrights including, but not limited to, those Commercial, Database and Moral, unless oth-erwise waived in writing.

The Copyright covers all files and data on this site / folder whether they bear individual notices or not.

License to use for research use only (i.e. non-commercial) governed by the law of England and Wales.

You agree to this License by downloading the data on this site whether in whole or in part.

You cannot re-distribute modified copies of these data, or de-rivative works, without my express written permission.  Where such permission is granted, you must cite the
original work and its Copyrights and you must include this li-cense with any work that includes any of my genome.

THIS WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND I SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES GREATER THAN £1.

Neither the names of Clive G. Brown, Oxford Nanopore Technolo-gies nor similar terms may be used to endorse or promote prod-ucts derived from this data without specific prior written per-mission.

Copyrighting rationales include any one or more of (but are not limited to) :

1. This is a ‘selfie’. The sequencer is analogous to a camera. I operated the ‘camera’ (in fact i had a hand in inventing and designing it too).

2. This is my source code. No previous Copyrights have ever been asserted over it. I have modified it creatively by making informed lifestyle choices, such that it now carries codes unique to me via factual molecular mechanisms such as mutation and epigenetic modification. The sequencer has provided a print off of a version of that code, and so I assert Copyrights over it.

3. Operating the sequencer is somewhat artful. Small individual variations in the style of operation of the sequencer can affect the outcome, for example, DNA fragment lengths.

4. We also recorded the sequencing process as a performance, and broadcast some of it on media. This data comprises part of that performance.
