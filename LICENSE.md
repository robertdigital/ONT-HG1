This is my source code. No previous Copyrights have ever been asserted over it. I have modified it creatively by making informed lifestyle choices, such that it now carries codes unique to me via factual molecular mechanisms such as mutation and epigenetic modification. The sequencer has provided a print off of a version of that code, and so I assert Copyrights over it.

Operating the sequencer is somewhat artful. Small individual variations in the style of operation of the sequencer can affect the outcome, for example, DNA fragment lengths.

We also recorded the sequencing process as a performance, and broadcast some of it on media. This data comprises part of that performance.
